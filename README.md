# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project was created to provide a visual representation for common (and uncommon) sorting algorithms.

## Build

{build instructions}

## Usage
Use the [start,previous,pause,next,last] keys to proceed through the algorithm.

//todo You can also use your keyboard to control the playbar.


## Supported algorithms
This project currently supports 2 different sorting algorithms, they include.
- selection sort
- bubble sort

## TODO
- heap sort
- counting sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- quick sort

### TODO even later

- Iterative Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Radix Sort
- Tim Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Comb Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Pigionhole Sort
- Sleep Sort
- Recursive Bubble Sort
- Cycle Sort
- Stooge Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Tag Sort
- Recursive insertion sort
- Strand Sort
- Tree Sort
- Bitonic Sort
- Cartesian Tree Sorting
- Iterative Merge Sort
- Pancake Sort
- Brick Sort
- Binary Insertion Sort
