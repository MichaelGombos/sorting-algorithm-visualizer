# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project was created to provide a visual representation for common (and uncommon) sorting algorithms.

## Build

{build instructions}

## Usage
Use the [start,previous,pause,next,last] keys to proceed through the algorithm.

//todo You can also use your keyboard to control the playbar.
